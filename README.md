# Stacks and Queues
C++ implementation of array-based stack and queue and their respective functions. 
## What is a stack?
A stack can be thought of as an array of items where the last item inserted, is the first one out, much like a stack of books. This principle can be remembered as LIFO (last in, first out). 
## What is a queue?
A queue consists of an array of items, much like a stack, except that the first item inserted, is often the first one out, or dequeued. This is similar to waiting in a line at the grocery store, where the first person out is whoever arrived at the line first, and the last person is inserted at the end of the line.
